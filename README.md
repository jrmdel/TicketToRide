# TicketToRide

## About

This project is about developing a Vue app and deploying it on https://jrmdel.github.io/TicketToRide using Firebase as an online database.

The goal is to store Ticket To Ride games between players, allowing them to add new tickets, to calculate automatically the score and to provide them with the top cities they go to. The first version should include Around the World and the Great Lakes tickets.
